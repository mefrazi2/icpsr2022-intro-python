This will include topics like loading data from files, manipulating the data, and creating visualizations. We will not really cover the standard list of libraries that one would learn in an introductory workshop on Python. Instead, the course will place more emphasis on libraries that can be of interest to the typical ICPSR audience."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### A bit about me\n4th year Physics PhD Student at the University of Michigan. I have been using Python for research and teaching for ~7 years now\n\n**Email**: imendoza@umich.edu \n\n**Website**: https://ismael-mendoza.github.io\n\n### Syllabus\nSyllabus is available on Canvas. Any problems accessing Canvas? \n\n### Nature of Assignments\nI will provide practice problems. I do not expect assignments to be turned in and I will not grade them. We can discuss the problems in office hours and in lectures (if time allows). \n\n### Zoom\n1. I will record the lectures and make the recordings available (it may take some time but hopefully the turnaround will be quick) \n2. We will use the break-out rooms feature to work in groups for people in zoom.\n\n### Installation\nAnaconda, Python 3, Jupyter Notebook. Any problems with installation? \n\n### Office Hours Poll\nCurrently, I have OH setup right after every class for 1hr. Please fill out this [poll](https://forms.gle/dwUSeBmzpwY67eqt7) so I can decide whether I need to shuffle them around. \n\nThere should also be extra time in lecture to have OH. We could also set up a time over email if none of the office hours times work."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents <a id='doc_outline'></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* [Jupyter Notebook](#jup_notebook)\n* [Keyboard Shortcuts](#shortcuts)\n* [Variables](#variables)\n* [Datatypes](#datatypes)\n* [Assignment for today](#assignment)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jupyter Notebook</span><a id='jup_notebooks'></a> [(to top)](#doc_outline)\n\nJupyter Notebook is part of <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/about\">Project Jupyter</a>, an open-source non-profit project. \n\nJupyter Notebook is one of the many computational notebooks available to data scientists.
